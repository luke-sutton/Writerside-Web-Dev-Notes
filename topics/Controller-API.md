# Controller API

Controller APIs use standard MVC architecture.
They provide a structured way to organize endpoints, models,
and business logic within dedicated controller classes.
Controllers offer a clear structure, separating concerns and
enhancing maintainability.

They are perfect for larger and more complex projects.
