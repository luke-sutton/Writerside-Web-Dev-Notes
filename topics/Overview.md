### Overview
I believe that explaining topics truly helps to understand them and to cement the concepts learned.

I created this site to fulfill that purpose by writing out learned topics in my own words or from examples
I have liked online, keeping them as simple and concise as possible, and to also have my notes easily available
to me everywhere, And if they can help anyone else that's great!

### Tech Stack
These notes will focus on my tech stack, which is -

Frontend
: Vue.js, .Net MVC, TypeScript or plain HTML, CSS & JS  

Backend
: C# .Net  

Database
: MS SQL
