# Overview

I wanted a place to keep my notes on web development and wanted to be able to access them online,
and so I have created this site.



### Tech Stack
These notes will focus on my chosen tech stack, which is -

Frontend
: Vue.js  or .Net mvc or plain HTML, CSS & JS  

Backend
: C# .Net or Javascript (node)  

Database
